This script checks for root privileges and upgrades the system before installing essential security tools such as Nmap, Netcat, Tcpdump, Wireshark, and John. It then disables root login via SSH, enables the firewall, and restricts incoming traffic. Finally, it displays the system hostname, IP address, and users.
